# Chris' Weekly Race Ruleset

The intention with my ruleset is to have a more advanced weekly race that allows for more glitches, such as Hyrule Castle item skips. I find the item skips fun and they add more variety to the seeds.

The goal is to have seeds last an average of 2-3 hours, requiring beating 3 random dungeons (excluding Palace of Twilight until it becomes available without Arbiter's Grounds) to gain access to Hyrule Castle.

Occasionally we may add a twist to the race, like using moonjump, actor replacement, etc.

Hints will be used once they're built in to the randmoizer.
