Corruptable archives:
- DAlways
- Ep
- J_tubo_00 (Blue Pot (small))
- TKS (Ooccoo in pots, cutscenes, and that greets you in dungeons; not the get item one)
- Obj_brg (bridge to Ook)
- Obj.so (Monkey cage)
- Obj_keyh (small key locks & chains)
- Npc_ks (monkey)
 
### Seemingly consistent corruptions
 
#### <ins>Lakebed</ins>
- DAlways, Ep
  - Max dupes in Right Wing Lower (RWL) -> max dupes in Helmasaur room -> back to RWL, back to Helmasaur room, back to RWL with rod in water underground (during a certain frame of it being in water)
 
- TKS, J_tubo_00 (seemingly determined at random)
	- With DAlways and Ep corrupted: Max dupes in central room -> dupe twice in Lizalfos room -> return to central room using opposite door you entered from (repeat until you get an archive corruption, doesn't seem to always happen first try)
 
#### <ins>Forest</ins>
- Obj_keyh, TKS
	- Max dupe in FT entrance -> max dupes in main room -> towards Ook -> to main room -> to BK room
 
- Obj_brg
	- Max dupes in FT entrance -> max dupes in main room -> towards Ook
 
### Additional Notes
- DAlways and Ep must be corrupted before you do any corruption in main room of LBT
- Some archives will cause mount archive error on title screen. One such archive known to cause this is J_tubo_00
- In some cases, you can corrupt multiple archives at once. This can happen when corrupting DAlways and Ep in Lakebed, but it's unknown what causes them to be done at same time
