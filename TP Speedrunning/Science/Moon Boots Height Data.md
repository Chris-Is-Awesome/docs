Note that these numbers are approximate. There is very slight variation in (especially) the height. +/- 5 units of variation at most
The numbers are in-game units as shown in tpgz
 
**MB frame 1:** 1st frame where both of Link's feet are off the ground. Gives most height (usually too much height for a bomb boost)

**MB frame 2:** Gives less height, perfect for most bomb boosts though

**MB frames 3-5:** Decrements height gained by a bit
