## Get Dual Boomerangs Equipped
1. Have no bow when you do this. Item slot 4 needs to be empty
2. Kill Shadow Beasts as wolf
3. Say yes to help Iza
4. Warp out
5. Say yes to help again after forced re-enter
6. Transform

This equips a null item to item slot 4 (bow) and sets both equip slots to slot 0 (rang, or whatever item is in that slot)
If you reload and help again, you'll get a permanent bow & bomb bag
